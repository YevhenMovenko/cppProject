## About
This was a school project and had several contributors. The project is not 100% complete and there is much room for improvement. However, you may find many of the techniques used here to be helpul in building your own games or programs. This game/program was designed to use a database for users to create accounts and log in. You would need to use your own databse and credentials if you would like to use this function. You can use the guest login button to bypass this.
